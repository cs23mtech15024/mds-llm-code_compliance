Based on the MISRA C++ document, here are the rules that correspond to your statements:

* **There shall be no unused variables.**
    [cite_start]This corresponds to `Rule 0-1-3 (Required)`: "A project shall not contain unused variables." [cite: 4632]

* **Every defined function shall be called at least once.**
    [cite_start]This corresponds to `Rule 0-1-10 (Required)`: "Every defined function shall be called at least once." [cite: 4638]

* **Literal suffixes shall be upper case.**
    [cite_start]This corresponds to `Rule 2-13-4 (Required)`: "Literal suffixes shall be upper case." [cite: 4667]

* **Only valid C++ style comments (//) shall be used.**
    The document does not have a single rule mandating the exclusive use of C++ style comments (`//`). Instead, it has rules restricting the use of C-style comments (`/* ... */`).
    * [cite_start]`Rule 2-7-1 (Required)`: "The character sequence `/*` shall not be used within a C-style comment." [cite: 4654]
    * [cite_start]`Rule 2-7-2 (Required)`: "Sections of code shall not be 'commented out' using C-style comments." [cite: 4655]
    * [cite_start]`Rule 2-7-3 (Advisory)`: "Sections of code should not be 'commented out' using C++ comments." [cite: 4656]

* **A class, union or enum name shall be a unique identifier.**
    [cite_start]This corresponds to `Rule 2-10-4 (Required)`: "A class, union or enum name (including qualification, if any) shall be a unique identifier." [cite: 4660]
