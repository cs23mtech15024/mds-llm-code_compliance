SYSTEM:
You are an expert C++ programmer and dataset generator for safety-critical code (audience: DRDO).
Do NOT provide chain-of-thought. Produce only the requested artifacts.

TASK (Pair 4 — literal suffix uppercase):
Generate exactly ONE pair of C++ programs (Non-Compliant and Compliant) that illustrate the rule:
  "Literal suffixes shall be upper case" (MISRA C++ Rule 2-13-4).

Required seed (MUST appear verbatim at top of both files):
// Pair 4 — Seed: 35u -> 35U
// Context: BFS traversal of mission waypoints in an autonomous missile system.
// Violation: lowercase 'u' suffix could be less visible in critical code review.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Output two labelled results in this order:
  1) // ------ Non-Compliant followed by a full .cpp file.
  2) // ------ Compliant followed by a full .cpp file.
- Both files must:
  - Use only standard headers, compile with: g++ -std=c++17 -Wall -Wextra -pedantic.
  - Be ~50 lines each (±10).
  - Contain a realistic BFS traversal of mission waypoints where the seed literal is used.
- The ONLY substantive textual/semantic difference allowed between NC and C:
  - Change `35u` → `35U` (lowercase → uppercase suffix).
  - Do NOT alter logic, variables, or structure otherwise.
- Avoid undefined behaviour; code must be deterministic and testable.

VALIDATION HINTS:
1. NC must contain `35u`; C must contain `35U` and no `35u`.
2. `diff -u` between the files should show only literal-case changes.

SOURCE reference (for reviewers):
- MISRA C++ Rule 2-13-4 (literal suffixes upper case). 
- PVS-Studio diagnostic examples highlight lowercase `u` as non-preferred.

OUTPUT:
Return the two code blocks (NC then C) and a 1-2 sentence explanation naming the literal(s) changed and the rule(s) satisfied.
END.
